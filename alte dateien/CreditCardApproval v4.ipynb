    "Below you can find a summary of the single subtasks you are required to work on during this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform a thorough analysis of the data. Preferably, use well-established tools from the Python package eco-system such as, e.g., [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) / [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). Another helpful tool is [Ydata Profiling](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to consider for the analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visualise as much as possible. Make your visualisation easy to understand by using, e.g., labels for the axes or titles.\n",
    "* Take into account differences regarding the features such as categorical vs. continuous.\n",
    "* Consider correlations between different features. Also analyse how single features are correlated with the target.\n",
    "* Check for missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply machine learning models of your choice to solve this classification task. Again, use appropriate tools such as those found in the [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) library. You may also consider using tools such as [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/) or a neural network based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure to split your data into train and test data before using any ML model.\n",
    "* Think about how to handle missing values and how to deal with features of different type (categorical and continuous). This also pertains to techniques such as feature encoding (e.g., refer to [this link form the Scikit-Learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html)) and feature engineering (e.g., frequency / count encoding or target encoding for categorical features).\n",
    "* Use data processing pipelines to have a clean way of preparing your data for a particular ML model. Note that different types of models (e.g., Logistic Regression vs. Gradient Boosted Trees) may require different preparation steps for the data.\n",
    "* Choose a proper metric (or several if appropriate) to evaluate a given model.\n",
    "* Optimise the hyper-parameters of your ML models to achieve the best possible performance on the data.\n",
    "* Compare different ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Document your workflow appropriately. If you choose to work with Juypter Notebooks this can be achieved by having dedicated notebooks for different parts of the project (e.g., EDA and ML models). Within a single notebook use sections and comments to document important decisions and the intent of your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebooks will look much cleaner and become a lot easier to comprehend if you avoid code duplication. That is, before using many code snippets that only differ slightly, consider finding a common abstraction and have a single dedicated place for this code (e.g., inside a function or a class) that enables easy reuse. It is oftentimes suitable to move code to a Python module. This module can then be readily imported in your Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be possible to (easily) reproduce your results by re-executing your notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are working in groups it must be obvious which group member has conducted which part of the work. Hence, please make sure to add annotations inside the docstring of functions / classes or appriate comments in the sections of your Jupyter notebooks."

Outline which tools you have used (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-Learn) and how you have approached the data to arrive at certain results. Also discuss the choice / usage of your ML models in relation to the EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a suitable medium such as ML-office-alike slides or Jupyter notebooks. If you are using the latter, please pay special attention to conciseness and a clean structure. Comprehensibly prepare your results by using, e.g., flow-charts for representing workflows and figures / tables for summarizing quantitative results.
